## What is NixOS?
- NixOS is a declarative Linux distribution. It is based on the Nix package manager, allowing reproducibility and portability.
- It's different from other distributions because of its non-FHS compliance and configuration.
- The whole configuration for the system is written inside a single configuration file `configuration.nix`. You can also find a `hardware-configuration.nix`, which you probably never have to edit. It contains the configuration for the hardware.
- After modifying the configuration files, you can run `sudo nixos-rebuild switch` to apply the changes or `sudo nixos-rebuild test` to test the changes.
- The `nixos-rebuild switch` command creates a new generation. So, in case the system breaks, you can roll back to a previous generation.
## What is Nix?
- Nix is a purely functional package manager that allows for declarative installation of packages.
- Nix can be used as a package manager, not just in NixOS, but in other Linux distributions and even in macOS.
- Packages in Nix are built from Nix expressions, which is a simple functional language.
- It allows multiple versions of the same package to be installed. Due to its hashing scheme, they don't interfere with each other.
- If you want to learn more about Nix, check out [nix pills](https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/00-preface)
## What is Flakes?
- Flakes is an experimental yet popular feature in NixOS that allows the pinning of versions of dependencies, making the system more reproducible.
- The version is pinned in a `flake.lock` file, and the flake expression is written in a `flake.nix` file.
- The pinned versions can be updated to a higher version with the `nix flake update` command.
## What is Home-Manager?
- Home-Manager helps in managing the user environment using the Nix package manager.
- Home-Manager can be installed as a module or a standalone tool.
- It allows you to configure user-specific utilities. For example, you can write the config for Hyprland using Home-Manager so that when you build the system, the configs will be applied automatically.
- Here is an example of my [ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) config
```nix
{...}: {
	programs.ghostty = {
	    enable = true;
	    settings = {
	      theme = "catppuccin-mocha";
	      font-size = 13;
	      background-opacity = 0.8;
	      font-family = "JetBrainsMono NF";
	      cursor-style = "bar";
	      window-padding-x = 10;
	      window-padding-y = 10;
	      confirm-close-surface = false;
	    };
	};
}
```
## Views
- I personally think NixOS is a great Linux distribution that combines stability and recency.
- Since it's non-FHS compliant, it might be hard switching to it initially. But once you get the hang of it, you're good to go.
- This might be the best distro for ricing since you can rice without the fear of breaking your system. If you do break it, just roll back.
- I did have issues setting a few things up, which I can say was a nightmare.
- Not at all a beginner-friendly distro.
- The learning curve is very steep, but that depends on how deep you go. NixOS can be a rabbit hole.
- You will have an exact idea of what's on your system since you are configuring almost everything declaratively.
- Best logo of all distros.
## Notes
### Note 1
- If you want to, say, set the GTK icon theme using the home-manager, you can fetch the package from nixpkgs but you may not know the exact theme name.
- <u>Example</u>
```nix
iconTheme.package = pkgs.dracula-icon-theme;
iconTheme.name = "Dracula";
```
- Here you may not know the exact theme name to pass to the `iconTheme.name`. To get the name, you can fetch the package and check the contents of it using the following command.
```bash
cd $(nix build nixpkgs#dracula-icon-theme --print-out-paths --no-link)
```
- This command lets you check the contents of the theme folder and get the exact theme name from it.
![Folder contents after fetching the package](assets/img/tech/nixos/icon.png)
- From this we can understand that the con theme name is **Dracula**.
### Note 2
- This is a great website if you want to check what options are available for a particular package - [https://mynixos.com/](https://mynixos.com/)
### Note 3
- Some themes or packages allow you to choose particular flavours to be installed instead of the whole theme/package.
- For example, the fluent GTK theme allows you to install particular flavours.
- You can select these specific flavours using the override option.
```nix
pkgs.fluent-gtk-theme.override {
	themeVariants = [ "purple" ];
	colorVariants = [ "dark" ];
	sizeVariants = [ "compact" ];
	tweaks = [ "round" "noborder" ];
}
```
### Note 4
- Some of the apps or themes that you need may not be available in nixpkgs. In such a situation, you will have to write your own nix derivation for it.
- Here is a resource you can reference for writing your own derivation - [write your own derivation](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/717168/how-to-package-my-software-in-nix-or-write-my-own-package-derivation-for-nixpkgs/717169#717169)
### Note 5
- In NixOS, you will generally use dev shells for setting up the development environment. The nix way of setting up a development environment is to create a dev shell.
- For example, for web development, you don't install Bun/Node globally. Instead you write a flake that activates a shell env with Node/Bun in it.
- Here is a collection of dev shell templates - [nix dev shell templates](https://github.com/the-nix-way/dev-templates) 
### Note 6
- You can also build your own NixOS Installer ISO, So that all your configs will be applied as soon as you install NixOS.
- I'll link Vimjoyer's video on this. He does great content on NixOS. [Vimjoyer's Video](https://youtu.be/-G8mN6HJSZE)
### Note 7
- When you modularize your NixOS config and write the config for each package in a separate file, make sure the file is staged before you run `sudo nixos-rebuild switch` or `home-manager switch` if the directory is git initialized.
- Or else Nix will throw an error that the file does not exist, even though it does.
### Note 8
- You can also temporarily install packages with `nix-shell -p <packageName>`. These packages only exist temporarily inside that particular shell. They are not installed globally.
- Here is an <u>example</u>
![nix-shell example](assets/img/tech/nixos/shell.png)
- Here, Microfetch by raf (also check out [nvf](https://github.com/NotAShelf/nvf) by raf if you use neovim) is installed using nix-shell, which is only available in that particular shell.
## Utilities
### Nix-Direnv
- Github - [nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv)
- As explained in the notes earlier, dev shells are created for development purposes. But activating the dev shell everytime you need to code can be tiresome and redundant.
- That’s why we have nix-direnv.
- Nix-Direnv will activate the dev shell every time you switch to a folder with a `flake.nix` or `shell.nix`.
### NVF
- If you are a Neovim user, you might find it hard to set things up and configure Neovim in Nixos.
- So to solve this problem, we have [nvf](https://github.com/NotAShelf/nvf).
- Here's a video by vimjoyer on how to get started with nvf - [Configure neovim with nvf](https://youtu.be/uP9jDrRvAwM)
### NH
- When you update your system the default way using `sudo nixos-rebuild switch`, you wouldn’t see much information on what changed during the update.
- [NH](https://github.com/nix-community/nh) allows you to get a better understanding on what is being done during the switch and what packages were removed/installed after the switch.
- You can also set NH to automate the task of removing the old system generations.
