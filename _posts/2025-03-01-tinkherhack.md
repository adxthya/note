## TinkHerHack?
- Tink-Her-Hack is an overnight girl's only hackathon organised by [Tinkerhub](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tinkerhub-scet/). It was organised in multiple colleges with over 50+ venues throughout Kerala.
- It was organised in my college too. Huge shoutout to [Sana Mohammed Sahi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sana-mohammed-sahi-b4a1a0253/), TinkerHub Campus Lead SCET and every other volunteers who  
helped in organising this event.
- The hackathon was conducted on Feb 1 and 2. The event started at around 2 pm on 1st Feb and ended on 11 am 2nd Feb.
## My role in it?
- I participated as a mentor for guiding the teams participating in the hackathon.
- GDG was also in collaboration with Tinkerhub in organising this event. Hence, GDG was handling the technical side of the hackathon. Me and [Angena Jaison](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angena-jaison-5aba4b254/) selected the mentors and handled other technical aspects of the hackathon. [Adwaith Jayansankar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adwaith-jayasankar-156539200/) - GDG Campus Lead guided and supported us through this.
- There were several other mentors with me. Everyone one of them were great and provided insights and advises to the teams who participated in the event.
- Along with the mentorship, We also conducted two workshops prior to the hackthon to throw some light into what development feels like.
- It was a great experience sharing my knowledge with others. I love to explain what I know and share what I know with others.
- The workshop was focused on HTML, CSS and Javascript and on how to host a website on Github.
## Experience?
- Since I was also in the technical team in organising the event It was a great experience for me to find out what it feels to organise an event.
- The event kicked off at 2 PM on February 1 with an inaugural ceremony. After verifying the teams and distributing goodies, the competition officially began.
- Got to meet and connect with a lot of students and it was great hearing about their ideas.
- Most of the mentors were given two teams to mentor. I also mentored two teams. One of the teams was from my class, and the other consisted of our juniors.
- Everyone was then busy up until midnight building their projects. At midnight the culturals were organised.
- Many were tired after all the events. Some slept but some of them coded till morning.
## The End
- I also didn't sleep till morning (or maybe for an hour?). So I was really tired too. We had breakfast and hung out for a bit.
- But now was the time for the results. The pariticipants pushed their code to github, hosted their projects and then the judgement begin.
- Many of them had really nice ideas but there has to be a winner right?
- The team who bagged the first position was team @user-not-found. Congratulations to them.
- Finally the prizes were distributed and everyone said good byes and it was time to leave.
- It was a good experience staying overnight, with friends, music and lots of code.
