Hi I am Adithya!!

I am currently pursuing my bachelor's in computer science. I am also a Linux and FOSS enthusiast. I currently use NixOS and Mint.

I am also a Full Stack Web Developer. I code in Python, JavasScript and Rust.

These are my personal collection of notes about the books I read and the technology I use. The books I read are non-fiction and the technology would be more focused on Linux and other tech stacks I use.
